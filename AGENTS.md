# AGENTS.md — Always-on rules (keep short)

**Purpose:** Reduce cascade bugs from multi-agent AI work — without freezing product evolution.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/cwahli/Health-tracker-6  
**Updated:** 2026-08-09  

**Token rule:** Read **this file first**. Load other docs **only when the table below says so**. Do not dump all domain rulebooks into every session.

---

## 0. Document roles (where context lives)

| Doc family | Role | Agents may freely update? |
|------------|------|---------------------------|
| **`AI_HANDOVER.md`** | **WIP board:** status so far, what’s in progress, next focus, multi-agent handoff notes | **Yes** — preferred place for session progress |
| **`plan/`** | **Architecture & planned design** (modal, food-calc, hybrid storage, bugs…) | Only when design actually changes; keep architecture durable |
| **`AGENTS.md` + `docs/agent/**`** | **Process laws + domain rulebooks + regression map** | **No — protected** (see §3) |
| **`studio/`** | One active Studio pack | Yes when authoring packs |
| **`archive/`** | Completed packs | Move on COMPLETE; do not re-upload as current |

```text
plan/          = what we designed / still intend (architecture)
AI_HANDOVER.md = where we are now (status, WIP, handoff)
AGENTS + docs/agent = how we work without breaking each other (stable process)
```

**Multi-agent context** goes in **`AI_HANDOVER.md`** (short “Session notes” / WIP rows), **not** by rewriting laws mid-flight.
** Doc / Ops tasks ** = if there are no update to codes skip gates runs and verification tables.

## 1. Load map (do not open everything)

| Task involves… | Read |
|----------------|------|
| Status / WIP / handoff | `AI_HANDOVER.md` |
| Architecture / planned design | matching file under `plan/` |
| Writing a Studio pack | `docs/agent/PACKS.md` |
| Food-calc | `docs/agent/domains/food-calc.md` |
| Biomarkers | `docs/agent/domains/biomarkers.md` |
| Multi-device sync | `docs/agent/domains/sync.md` |
| Which tests to run | `docs/agent/DOMAIN_REGRESSION_MAP.md` |
| IMPACT / SELF-CHECK / GATE paste | `docs/agent/TEMPLATES.md` |
| Active Studio pack name | `studio/ACTIVE_STATUS.md` |

**Default loop:** board (`AI_HANDOVER`) → domain rulebook if needed → implement → domain gates → COMPLETE format → update board.

## 2. Coding Laws (every session)

### L1 — Blast radius (anti-random-deletion)
Touch **only** files required for the task. No drive-by refactors, renames, or “cleanup.”  
Do not remove branches, error handlers, fallbacks, or **mode-tagged / gate-used logs** unless listed in scope.

### L2 — Contracts
No breaking signature/API/prop changes without updating **all** call sites in the same task. Prefer optional params + defaults.

### L3 — Scope honesty
- **S** (1 file): implement directly.  
- **M** (multi-file): ≤3-bullet plan then code.  
- **L/X** (multi-path, merge, sync, dictionary): paste **IMPACT** first (`docs/agent/TEMPLATES.md`). Scope grows → **stop and report**.

### L4 — Full implementation
No placeholders or stub delivery. Import without **correct-path call site** = FAIL.

### L5 — Sibling paths
One path fixed ≠ feature done. Shared helper + all call sites, **or** explicit known-broken in `AI_HANDOVER.md`.

### L6 — Data field preservation
Do not drop existing merge/construct fields unless scoped + consumers audited.

### L7 — Detect AND repair
Detection-only is incomplete when repair is in scope.

### L8 — Prefer extract over god-file rewrites
Hot pure logic → small modules + tests; thin call sites in `server.ts` / `App.tsx`.

### L9 — Domain rulebooks: guide, don’t fossilize
If the task hits food-calc / biomarkers / sync: **read** that domain file.

- Default: follow invariants (they prevent the regressions we already paid for).  
- **Product evolution is allowed:** if the app intentionally changes a pipeline, key scheme, or store role, update the rulebook **with confirmation** (§3) **in the same change**, and update tests/gates.  
- Do **not** invent a silent alternate pipeline “just for this bug.”  
- Do **not** treat rulebooks as a ban on new features — only as a checklist against accidental breakage.

### L10 — COMPLETE
All of: IMPACT (L/X) · SELF-CHECK · `tsc` · domain regression map commands · pack assert if any · paths verified or known-broken noted.

**Forbidden until then:** “all done” / “fully verified” / “nothing left.”  
**Auto FAIL:** import without call site · silent half-fix · detect without repair · dropped fields · gate weakened · drive-by scope.

---

## 3. Protected docs (confirmation + before/after required)

These files define how **all** agents work. Random edits dilute process and break multi-agent coordination.

**Protected set:**

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent/**` (rulebooks, PACKS, DOMAIN_REGRESSION_MAP, TEMPLATES, README)
- Gate scripts that encode pack acceptance (`scripts/assert-*.mjs`) **when changing acceptance meaning** (not when only adding a new assert file for a pack)

### Rules

1. **Do not edit protected docs** as part of an unrelated feature/bugfix.  
2. If a protected edit is needed (evolution, correction, new domain):  
   - **Stop and ask the human for confirmation** first, **or** only do it when a Studio pack explicitly lists that file as in-scope.  
   - Show **before → after** for each protected file (or a clear unified diff summary).  
   - State **why** (product change / missing invariant / token fix).  
3. Prefer recording ephemeral status in **`AI_HANDOVER.md`**, not by rewriting laws.  
4. When product evolution changes an invariant: update domain rulebook + tests **together** so process stays honest — never leave stale laws that contradict code.

## 4. Git / GitHub: commits only via AI Studio

**Binding (agents forget this — read twice):**

| Who | May commit / push to `origin`? |
|-----|--------------------------------|
| **AI Studio** (Studio pack session with human) | **Yes** — after gate exit 0 |
| Grok / Claude / Cursor / other local agents | **No** — prepare files, packs, gates only |

Local agents **must not**:

- `git commit` / `git push` / force-push / amend published history to GitHub  
- “Just ship it” after a chat fix  

Local agents **may**:

- Edit the working tree  
- Run tests/gates  
- Update `AI_HANDOVER.md` WIP notes  
- Author `studio/M*.md` for the human to upload  

**Ship path:**

```text
Local agent prepares code + studio pack
  → human uploads pack (+ docs if needed) to AI Studio
  → AI Studio applies / verifies gate exit 0
  → AI Studio commits + pushes to GitHub
  → board (AI_HANDOVER) updated; pack archived
```

Full pack craft: `docs/agent/PACKS.md`.

---

## 5. Change classes

| Class | Examples | Process |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **S** | Copy, CSS | light |
| **M** | One helper + tests | unit tests |
| **L** | Multi-mode food, biomarker pipeline | domain doc + regression map + IMPACT |
| **X** | Sync/tombstones, identity, protected docs | confirmation + IMPACT + second look |

---

## 6. Studio packs (summary)

1. One active pack under `studio/`.  
2. ≤6 acceptance IDs; FIND→REPLACE / small swaps; machine gate exit 0.  
3. **Commit/push = AI Studio only** (§4).  
4. After true COMPLETE: archive pack; update `AI_HANDOVER.md`.

---

## 7. Bugs (token-saving)

Prefer `GET /api/bugs/open`; a11y + `domain_pack.json`; deep-fetch only if blocked.  
Spec: `plan/BUG_TRACKING_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md`.

---

## 8. Keep this file short

If always-on content grows past ~one screen of laws + index, **move detail out** (with §3 confirmation) — do not dilute context with pack templates or full domain tables here.
